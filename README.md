# Gmail Labeling Script: "Contact Exists"

This Google Apps Script automatically labels Gmail threads with the "Contact Exists" label if the sender's email address exists in your Google Contacts. If the sender is not in your contacts, the email will be labeled as "Not in Contacts." This helps you efficiently organize and manage your inbox by processing only unlabeled emails.

## Features

- Searches recent, unlabeled emails in your Gmail inbox.
- Checks if the sender's email address exists in your Google Contacts.
- Labels the email thread with "Contact Exists" if a match is found.
- Labels the email thread with "Not in Contacts" if the sender is not in your contacts.
- Ensures that emails are processed only once, avoiding reprocessing.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and configure this script:

### 1. Create a New Google Apps Script Project

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/).
2. Click on **New Project**.
3. Name your project (e.g., "Gmail Contact Labeler").

### 2. Copy the Script

Copy the following code into the Apps Script editor:

```javascript
function addLabelIfContactExists() {
  var lock = LockService.getScriptLock();
  
  if (lock.tryLock(30000)) {
    try {
      processEmails();
    } finally {
      lock.releaseLock();
    }
  } else {
    Logger.log("Script is already running. Exiting to prevent overlap.");
  }
}

function processEmails() {
  // Search for emails from the last day that have no labels
  var threads = GmailApp.search('newer_than:1d has:nouserlabels'); 
  var contactLabel = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('Contact Exists');
  var notInContactsLabel = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName('Not in Contacts');
  
  if (!contactLabel) {
    contactLabel = GmailApp.createLabel('Contact Exists');
  }
  
  if (!notInContactsLabel) {
    notInContactsLabel = GmailApp.createLabel('Not in Contacts');
  }

  for (var i = 0; i < threads.length; i++) {
    var messages = threads[i].getMessages();
    for (var j = 0; j < messages.length; j++) {
      var from = messages[j].getFrom();
      var email = extractEmail(from);
      if (isContactExists(email)) {
        threads[i].addLabel(contactLabel);
      } else {
        threads[i].addLabel(notInContactsLabel);
      }
    }
  }
}

function isContactExists(email) {
  var contacts = ContactsApp.getContactsByEmailAddress(email);
  return contacts.length > 0;
}

function extractEmail(fromField) {
  var emailPattern = /<(.+)>/;
  var match = fromField.match(emailPattern);
  return match ? match[1] : fromField;
}

```

### 3. Authorize the Script

1. Click the **Run** button (â–º) in the Apps Script editor.
2. A dialog will appear asking for permission to access your Gmail and Contacts. Review and authorize the permissions.

### 4. Set Up a Trigger

To have the script run automatically:

1. Click on the clock icon (Triggers) in the Apps Script editor.
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**.
3. Select `addLabelIfContactExists` for the function to run.
4. Set the time-based trigger to run every minute, hourly, daily, etc., based on your preference.

### 5. Customize the Script (Optional)

- **Search Query**: The script searches for emails from the last day that have no labels using `newer_than:1d -label:*`. You can adjust the search query to fit your needs.
- **Label Names**: Change the label names from `"Contact Exists"` and `"Not in Contacts"` to something else if you prefer different labels.

### 6. Save and Test

- After setting everything up, save your project.
- Run the script manually or wait for the trigger to execute.
- Check your Gmail to see if the appropriate emails have been labeled with "Contact Exists" or "Not in Contacts."
